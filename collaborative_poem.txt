A blanket is comforting as we work from a far.
Below are the musings from learners of R:

I rather enjoy a hot cup of tea.
Drinking it fills my heart with such glee.

The weather is nice yet I stay in and code.
Does it count if the window is open to my abode?

Studying at home is my new thing, 
Learning in R will improve my skills.

My sleep schedule is shot.
But I still think I'll learn a lot.

Hoping to make GitHub my new friend,
Otherwise my grades will show a pretty sad trend.

Studying while drinking some coffee.
I do wish I also had some toffee.

As we prepare to ramp up for another semester,
I find my itch to roam begin to fester.

This assignment is due at midnight.
I think I'll be alright. 

Today is a new day,
So lets lean new things in a new way

Tentin Quarantino.
Stuck in a casino.

I can hear the clock ticking time,
as I try to write these lines. 

R is hard in the beginning,
But once you learn, you know youre winning.
It makes analyzing data a breeze,
With so many packages, life is an ease.
What would we do in a life without R,
especially since there is no open bar. 

With all that is going on it has lately been quite a bummer,
But this will be quite a fun and exciting way to start the summer!

I am still recovering from brain drain this past winter.
After all, I spent a lot of time learning Python's Tkinter.

They say you can not rhyme "rhyme" with "rhyme",
but otherwise I cannot rhyme.
